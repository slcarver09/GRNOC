#### GRNOC Script Repository
##### I am using this to keep track of ongoing scripts that I have needed to create for various GRNOC/Internet2 projects

##### Things to note
      - If you need to run a script, please make sure you know what it does before you run it. 
      - A lot of these are tied to the DB and you could potentially wipe/overwrite data
      - If you do need to run a script, you will need to update the realm
      - You do not need a service account, just your Internet2 Username/Password
